Hi! I'm Amanda.
I'm a Lighting and Lookdev VFX Artist, recently graduated from the Savannah College of Art & Design.

My goal is to create art that sparks awe! Growing up moving around different countries, I gained a huge admiration for the vibrancy of street cultures and now draw creative inspiration from this diversity of people around me. I like to highlight the little moments of joy quietly pocketed within everyday life.
