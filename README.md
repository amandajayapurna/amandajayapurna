Hi! I'm Amanda.
I'm a Lighting and Lookdev VFX Artist, recently graduated from the Savannah College of Art & Design.

Recently I've been taking some online coding courses and have been keen on diving into learning Python, C++, USD and tool building in order to develop skills in my growing interest for Technical Direction for Lighting. The following repositories contain both classwork excercises as well as personal VFX projects in the works.
